# Mask_Detection-Live-
This is a project wherein live mask detection has been done using Open-cv and tensorflow.
I have used VGG16 for pretrained weights and binary classification was performed on the dataset from kaggle.
"Live Mask" file contains the code for face detection. Haar-cascade xml file has been used to doso.
Mask.model is the model folder.
